## Fixed drivers for Wacom Bamboo, Graphire, Intuos 1, 2, 3, and Cintiq 1st gen tablets on macOS Catalina / Big Sur

Wacom's drivers for Bamboo, Graphire, Intuos 1, 2 & 3 and Cintiq 1st gen tablets have bugs in them that

## Install the fixed driver

First, download the correct driver for your tablet:

- [Fixed driver v6.1.6-4 for Graphire 1 & 2 and Intuos 1 & 2](https://github.com/thenickdude/wacom-driver-fix/releases/download/patch-10/Install-Wacom-Tablet-6.1.6-4-patched.pkg)
- [Fixed driver v5.2.6-5 for Graphire 3](https://github.com/thenickdude/wacom-driver-fix/releases/download/patch-10/Install-Wacom-Tablet-5.2.6-5-patched.pkg)
- [Fixed driver v5.3.0-3 for Graphire 4](https://github.com/thenickdude/wacom-driver-fix/releases/download/patch-10/Install-Wacom-Tablet-5.3.0-3-patched.pkg)
- [Fixed driver v5.3.7-6 for Bamboo](https://github.com/thenickdude/wacom-driver-fix/releases/download/patch-10/Install-Wacom-Tablet-5.3.7-6-patched.pkg)
- [Fixed driver v6.3.15-3 for Intuos 3 and Cintiq](https://github.com/thenickdude/wacom-driver-fix/releases/download/patch-10/Install-Wacom-Tablet-6.3.15-3-patched.pkg)

Run the installer to install the driver.

Now we need to remove the permissions that were leftover from the old driver: 

- Click the Apple menu, then System Preferences, Security and Privacy
- On the Privacy tab, select Accessibility and click the lock in the bottom left to make changes. You'll be asked to enter your login credentials.
- Select any Wacom items in the list (PenTabletDriver, ConsumerTouchDriver, WacomTabletSpringboard, etc) and click the "-" button to remove them.
- Do the same on the "Input Monitoring" page 
- Restart the computer

Now we can add permissions for the new fixed driver:

- Touch the pen tip to the tablet once
- Click the Apple menu, then System Preferences, Security and Privacy
- On the Privacy tab, select Accessibility and click the lock in the bottom left to make changes. You'll be asked to enter your login credentials.
- Make sure any Wacom items in the list (PenTabletDriver, ConsumerTouchDriver, WacomTabletSpringboard, etc) are ticked
- Do the same on the "Input Monitoring" page 

![Add new permissions](screenshots/en-AU/security-and-privacy-tick.jpg)

Your tablet should now be working! You may need to restart the computer one more time.
